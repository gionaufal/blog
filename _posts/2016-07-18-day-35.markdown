In the last weeks I've been diving in [the odin project](http://theodinproject.com). I have completed some interesting projects, such as recreating the [Google Homepage](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gionaufal/the_odin_project/blob/master/html-css/index.html) (needs improvements, I was a bit lazy on this one), making a [jQuery Slider](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gionaufal/the_odin_project/blob/master/jquery-slider/index.html#) and building a [Etch-a-sketch](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gionaufal/the_odin_project/blob/master/js-jquery/index.html).

There projects were great for me to remember a lot about basic Javascript and jQuery. After that, I started to go deeper in Ruby, and as I had already started with the language, it wasn't so hard. The resources indicated by the odin project were great, specially [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram), a book with great examples (and great sense of humor too!).
After practicing with Ruby it isn't hard to understand why so many people love the language. Compared to Javascript, it feels a lot more elegant and fun to write.
