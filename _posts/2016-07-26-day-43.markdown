This week I'm learning more about React. And before you ask, no, I haven't finished the Odin Project. But the thing is: I found some really nice job opportunities that have React as a requirement.

I'm initially learning from [this react course](http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/courses/reactjsfundamentals). I found this course via [this post](https://medium.com/@bonham000/why-i-built-free-code-camps-front-end-projects-twice-c3dadfd03b6a#.x5x7anq3j) from a student from FreeCodeCamp, which lead me to [his site](http://sean-smith.me/assets/portfolio/25-react-projects/index.html) where Sean goes through his whole learning process. This is a great place to find react tutorials.

Another thing I found out this week is that [some commits just doens't count](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/) in your github contributions. For example, if you commit something to a forked repo and don't make a pull request, this commit won't count. This is one reason that I have some missing days (other missing days were just lost, no problem admitting it) 

This week, finishing the React course, I will try to rebuild the first Free Code Camp projects. Stay tunned!
