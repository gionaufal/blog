For some obscure reason, my home internet died last monday. As all of the tutorials I want to follow now are video based, I can't route my mobile internet.

So I just followed a [simple React tutorial](http://buildwithreact.com/tutorial) which brings only the basic concepts from React + JSX. At least for now I will have to follow only text based tutorials and projects.
