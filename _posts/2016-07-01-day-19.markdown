The exercise today was implementing something that I learnt yesterday in the Meetup CSS. I chose to update my [portfolio site](http://gionaufal.com) and to make some CSS animations.

The chosen feature was a flip card animation in the portfolio itens. Since I made this section I've wanted to improve it, and now it is way better than before. I still have to make some alternative for touch devices, since the flip card only works on mouse over, but I'm happy with the result.
