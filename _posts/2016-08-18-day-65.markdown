Yesterday was my first day at Campus Code. We started with a basic exercise in Ruby: making a command line aplication to include words in english and their translation in portuguese.

It was a great start! With this exercise we could practice basic Ruby concepts such as:
* String manupulation
* Array manupulation
* Hash manupulation
* Loops
* Conditionals
* Variables
* Methods

Today we will go deeper in those concepts. This first week will be a warm up, but we'll start our individual projects.

Code your future!
