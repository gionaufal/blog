The hard thing of this challenge is building the habit. I don't have a lot of free time, but I do have one hour in the morning and I can find one in the evening.

Another hard thing to chose is the language I'm practicing. I just started [codesaga](http://codesaga.com.br), a learning platform for Ruby, similar to [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com), but in Portuguese and with their own git server to validate the exercises. I'll post my solutions in [this repo](https://github.com/gionaufal/codesaga). And maybe I'll go back to The Odin Project again, as I have already started once or twice (like [this Tic Tac Toe game](https://github.com/gionaufal/tic-tac-toe) that was made for the project).
