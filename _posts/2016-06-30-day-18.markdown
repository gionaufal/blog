Today I attended a CSS Meetup. There were 2 pannels, the first [(Afonso Pacifer)](http://afonsopacifer.com/) about drawing with CSS and the second [(Willian Justen)](https://willianjusten.com.br/) about math in CSS.

Both pannelists were great, and I'm sure I left knowing a lot more then when I entered the meetup. Now I have some ideas about how to implement both things, and will put to practice in the next days.
